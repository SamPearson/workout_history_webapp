# Pre-existing work
The video below provides a template for building a website in python.
It has enough features to provide a robust baseline; 
for this project I'll be building it into a workout history tracker.
If you'd like to build something different you may
want to look at this tutorial as a starting point.

# Workout History Webapp

Users will be able to select a set of exercises they have the equipment for.
Once a user has an exercise list, they can
- select and view an exercise
- view a random exercise
- have a workout randomly generated
- log info related to a workout they've completed

When enough data is stored for a user, they will be able to see things like
- time since a given exercise has been performed
- max weight for an exercise and calculated percentages thereof
- days since the last skip day

all of this should be stored on a per-user basis, with the possible exception of
a comprehensive list of exercises.
